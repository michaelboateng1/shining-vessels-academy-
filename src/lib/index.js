		question: 'What programs does Shining Vessels Academy offer?',
		answer: 'We specialize in three core programs: Coding & Programming, Abacus Mental Math, and Robotics & AI. Our curriculum is designed to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical skills in students of all ages.'
	},
	{
		question: 'What age groups do you accept?',
		answer: 'We welcome students from ages 5 to 18. Our programs are tailored to different age groups and skill levels, with age-appropriate content and teaching methods for each level.'
	},
	{
		question: 'What are the benefits of learning Abacus?',
		answer: 'Abacus training enhances mental calculation speed, improves concentration, boosts memory, and develops both left and right brain functions. It also helps in building a strong foundation in mathematics.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Do students need prior coding experience?',
		answer: 'No prior experience is needed. Our coding programs start from beginner levels with block-based programming and gradually progress to advanced programming languages based on the student\'s pace and understanding.'
	},
	{
		question: 'What makes your Robotics program unique?',
		answer: 'Our Robotics program combines hands-on building with programming, teaching students about electronics, mechanics, and coding. Students work on real-world projects that encourage creativity and innovative thinking.'
	},
	{
		question: 'What are your class schedules?',
		answer: 'We offer flexible scheduling with weekday after-school classes and weekend sessions. Each program typically meets once or twice a week, with each session lasting 1-2 hours depending on the course level.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Do you offer trial classes?',
		answer: 'Yes, we offer trial classes for new students to experience our teaching methodology before enrolling in a full program. Contact our admissions team to schedule a trial session.'
	},
	{
		question: 'How do you track student progress?',
		answer: 'We use a combination of continuous assessments, project-based evaluations, and regular parent-teacher meetings to track and communicate each student\'s progress and areas for improvement.'
